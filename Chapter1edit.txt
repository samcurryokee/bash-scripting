#ERROR HANDLING

mkdir ../otherfolder
#this command gives permission to read some of the files but will cause errors later on. This command blocks permission to read the 015 extension files 
chmod 000 *_015*
#the *v in the copy commadn is used to mean verbose in that it shows how each file is coppied individualy

cp -v *../otherfolder

rm ../otherfolder*

# 1 and 2 represent standard output and standard error respectively and the > sign
#represents redirecting the output of this command somewhere else and are one level up
#this is handy when you want to capture the output of commands that you are running
cp -v * ../otherfolder 1>../success.txt 2>../error.txt

#to chck the files we use the cat command

#Permissions
#To change the permissions of any files or directories we use the chmod(change mode) command
#one way is by use of numeric values to rep permission type

chmod 664 test1

#the other way to change permission of a specific user is symbolic method
#here we use signs + adds a permission to a directory or file - removes the permission = sets the permission and overides the permission set earlier

#to change the permission of the user use u, to change tose of the group use g, and to change those of the world use o and to change permssions for all use a

chmod u+rwx test1
chmod u=rwx, go=r test1
 #Changing ownership and group
 sudo chown root test1

 #changing group ownership

 newgrp cdrom 
 chgrp cdrom test1
